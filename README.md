# englishgameswebsite
A website for language learners that contains two javascript games. One for vocabulary the other numeracy.

This website is done in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It contains an index.html file which welcomes users to a website dedicated to English language learners. The website's menu contains links to two games.

The first is basically a fruit ninja themed game where the user must attempt to slice fruit based on the sound prompt. It is in English however can easily be modified for Spanish, French etc. 

The second is a times tables game for numbers one to ten. This allows the user to read the numbers one to ten (e.g. three x two). The user then has a multiple choice grid to select the best answer. A timer is set at 30 seconds and the user's score is based on how many correct answers they have gotten during this time.
